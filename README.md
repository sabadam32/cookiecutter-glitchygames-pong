# cookiecutter-glitchygames-pong
A template for pong using [Glitchy Games](https://github.com/terrysimons/glitchygamess) engine.  This engine is an attempt to make a beginner friendly game development environment for educational purposes targeting the Raspberry Pi platform.  As part of that I am adding templates to the engine for starter games.
